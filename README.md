# Library Management System - BSC Database Lab Project

# Description:

My BSC project in the Database Lab focused on creating a Library Management System. This hands-on experience has been instrumental in my learning journey, providing me with a solid foundation in SQL and database systems concepts. The skills that I have gained during this project have helped me a lot in my career, especially in transitioning to become a Data Analyst and embarking on my data science journey.
